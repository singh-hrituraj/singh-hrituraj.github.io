<br>I am a Research Scientist/Engineer at <a href="https://research.adobe.com/person/hrituraj-singh/"> Adobe Research, India</a>. Prior to that,
I was an undergraduate student at <a href="https://iitr.ac.in/"> Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee</a>. My research interests revolve
around Natural language Processing and its relation with other fields such as vision. I grew up in a tiny beautiful village with a population
of 200 people near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moradabad"> Moradabad, India</a>. 
<br><br>When I am not training my models, I am travelling, eating, or binge watching
Ronaldo's goals. I also sing, sometimes.
